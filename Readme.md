## Permissions & Transparency

This app is designed to operate on files you explicitly select in Finder and to write the resulting PDF in the same folder. It does not transmit data over the network.

When you run the Quick Action, macOS may prompt for permissions related to:

- **Finder automation** (to select or reveal the output file in Finder).

If you don’t want to grant automation permissions, you can still use the app; it will just skip any automation-related behavior.

## Security Notes

- The app processes PDFs and images locally on your machine.
- Only files you select in Finder are opened and processed.
- The output PDF is created in the same directory as the first selected file (or Desktop if unavailable).
